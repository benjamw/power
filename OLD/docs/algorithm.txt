
CURRENTLY WORKING ON:
still working on getting flag captures figured
for two or more players who capture each other at the same time
(all are completely removed from the board)

getting javascript to work for the execute command


basic game algorithm
---------------------------------------
not started
- started
-- about half-way
--- completed (some testing)
---> tested and finalized (although there may be changes)
=======================================

--- get moves from user
  ---> via manual entry
  via javascript point and click
--- generate movable board based on current piece position
--- test moves for validity (in order)
--- test moves for already moved pieces
--- test moves for correct color (not just any color)
--- put valid moves in database
--- extract valid moves from database
--- repeat as necessary until user finalizes
- update database upon user finalization

-- retrieve moves from database
-- generate movable board based on current piece position
- perform moves, in order, to completion

--- test for conflicts
-- resolve conflicts (who won, lost, tied)
-- remove and add pieces from conflicts to winners reserve
bounce ties
-- repeat as necessary (based on bounces)

-- test for flag captures
email losers
-- remove and add pieces from captures to winners reserve

-- determine incapacitated players and mark as such

LOG ALL HAPPENINGS

email players of completion of turn

retrieve pieces from database
draw board

generate reviewability of board (javascript or possibly php)

    test for simultaneous flag captures FIRST
      (two colors capture each other at same time)
    resolve simultaneous flag captures (kill all)
    LEAVE SINGLE FLAG CAPTURES

    if any ambiguous conflict winnings
      email player about it
    else
      test for multiple flag captures FIRST
      resolve multiple flag captures (kill all)
      get flag captures
      resolve flag captures

      if ambiguous flag winnings
        email player about it
      else
        save board
  else
    save commands to database history

if players fix ambiguous conflict winnings
  if no more ambiguous conflict winnings
    test for multiple flag captures FIRST
    resolve multiple flag captures (kill all)
    get flag captures
    resolve flag captures

    if ambiguous flag winnings
      email player about it
    else
      save board

if player fix ambiguous flag winnings

END----


save board means:
if game over
  mark as such
  email all players

if dead players
  mark as such
  email dead players

if incapacitated players
  mark as such
  email incapacitated players

clean board
