CODES FOR SECTORS
This graphic shows the basic layout of the board
Each color gets a quadrant. Q is Headquarters.
U is reserve (not on board, but on screen).
Islands and all Sea Lanes are neutral.

Colors
Y - Yellow
K - Black
R - Red
A - White

Islands
N - between Y and K
W - between Y and R
E - between K and A
S - between R and A
X - center of board

Sea lanes
Counted clockwise from inside to outside starting with the northern
most sea lane. (see above)  No sea lane is adjacent to any other sea
lane, movement between sea lanes must pass through a non-sea lane
sector. (Colors indicate the head quarters for that color)
L01 - between X and N
L02 - between X and E
L03 - between X and S
L04 - between X and W
L05 - between W and Y
L06 - between Y and N
L07 - between N and K
L08 - between K and E
L09 - between E and A
L10 - between A and S
L11 - between S and R
L12 - between R and W

Country Sectors
Each country owns a Headquarters (where the flag is kept) and a nine
sector land mass (0-8) with 0 being next to X and 8 next to your own Q
Each sector is denoted in the game be prepending the color code to the
sector number, for instance, sector 5 on yellow side: Y5, sector 2 on
white side: W2, etc.
The Headquarters is denoted similarly: YQ, KQ, etc.
All sectors in each country are both sea and land sectors, only one
sector in each country is strictly a land sector and that is sector 4.

Reserves
Reserves are denoted with a U after the color code (like Q and 0-8)
YU, KU, RU, AU
Behind the HQ


MOVES
Moves are written by denoting the piece, the starting sector, and the
ending sector, in that order, separated by a dash. No spaces.

Examples:
I-Y4-X   = Infantry from Yellow 4 to Island X
H-A6-A0  = Heavy from White 6 to White 0
D-S12-W  = Destroyer from Sea Lane 12 to Island W
B-RQ-A0  = Bomber from Red Headquarters to White 0
G-AU-WQ  = Regiment from White Reserve to White HQ

For two or three player games with more than one color, prepend piece
code with color code
Examples:
RI-Y4-X   = Red Infantry from Yellow 4 to Island X
KH-A6-A0  = Black Heavy from White 6 to White 0
YD-S12-W  = Yellow Destroyer from Sea Lane 12 to Island W
AB-RQ-A0 = White Bomber from Red Headquarters to White 0
KG-AU-WQ = Black Regiment from White Reserve to White HQ

Color codes will be added to commands upon submittal of those commands


EXCHANGES

Exchanges are denoted by the number of pieces and which piece, the
sector the exchange is on, and the new piece prepended with >, in that
order, separated by a dash. No spaces.

Examples:
3T-K2->H = 3 Tanks on Black 2 exchanged for 1 Heavy
3I-N->G  = 3 Infantry on Island N exchanged for 1 Regiment
3P-AU->T = 3 Power Units on White Reserve exchanged for 1 Tank
Z-Y2->M  = As much as needed on Yellow 2 exchanged for 1 Megamissle
(NOTE: Z code only works for Megamissle exchanges)

For two or three player games with more than one color, prepend piece
code with color code
Examples:
3RT-K2->RH = 3 Red Tanks on Black 2 exchanged for 1 Red Heavy
3KI-N->KG  = 3 Black Infantry on Island N exchanged for 1 Black Regiment
3AP-AU->AT = 3 White Power Units on White Reserve exchanged for 1 White Tank
YZ-Y2->YM  = As much Yellow as needed on Yellow 2 exchanged for 1 Yellow
Megamissle
