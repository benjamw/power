 - store initial board in create function

 - get create function working fully, so I can test game functions
	and figure out database structures, and where power / game data needs to be



- store bounces and captures in the gmae history table as well
	maybe think up something for multiple bounces and multiple conflicts
		some kind of multi-dimensional array type thing ?

- have settable extra info options for things like:
	allow blank moves
	custom starting armies
	allow more than max pieces (max out at given pieces, 10 power points, etc)
	allow more than 10 power points to be stored in reserve (see above)
	give x power points every round no matter what
	give x power points for occupying enemy territory
	give power point for each enemy territory occupied (instead of just one total)
	different number of moves per turn (could be 3 or 7)
	allow exchange and move (instead of not, as in original)
	allow any piece to capture flag
	custom move distance per piece

- maybe do something like hide board after showing previous move and then have the player click
	a button that shows the board for 3 minutes while they make their moves
	once they are done, any incomplete moves are invalid and forfeit and moves are automatically
	submitted
		maybe have an option for this in the create game page
